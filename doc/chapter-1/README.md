# Architecture

The IT Operator consists of two parts, the [Control](https://github.com/alinex/node-control)
and the [REST](https://github.com/alinex/node-rest) servers.

![Environment](doc/environment.png)

The [Control](https://github.com/alinex/node-control) server delivers a web application
and builds the desktop and mobile apps to be used. They are all the same on different
devices. They all contact and get their data from the central
[REST](https://github.com/alinex/node-rest) servers which may be load balanced and
clustered for high scalability.

## Components

REST Server (default)
