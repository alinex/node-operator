# ASSETS

The `assets` directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript.

Also you may add ready to use elements like images which:
- will also be placed in the same static folder
- will be hashed for better cache management
- will served inline if very small

More information about the usage of this directory in the documentation:
