# LAYOUTS

The `layouts` directory contains your Application Layouts.

There are two special layouts like:
- `default` - which is the one used if no other layout is specified within your pages
- `error` - which is used for error pages

To use a specific layout define it in your page:

``` javascript
export default {
  layout: 'title'
}
```
