# STORE

This directory contains your Vuex Store files.
Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework.

Nuxt.js lets you have 2 modes of store, choose the one you prefer:
- **Classic**: `store/index.js` returns a store instance
- **Modules**: every `.js` file inside the store directory is transformed as a
  namespaced module (index being the root module)

More information about the usage of this directory in the documentation:
